Recent Earthquakes - Gathering and Sharing Information with the USGS Website
Notes from webinar session with USGS and NOAA scientists about finding most relevant earthquake info

Presenters:
Lisa Wald, Wendy Bohon, Beth, Cindy 

Session facilitated by Jason Ballman, Southern California Earthquake Center
University of Southern California  

## How find most relevant earthquake info:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/
Focus on right side of page:

Earthquake Notification Service ENS - In Latest Earthquakes section https://earthquake.usgs.gov/ens/
You’ll get info about quakes around the world and the U.S. You can set default magnitudes, describe your own region with the polygons, etc. She suggests you don’t change your default settings all the time. 

You can also edit your info and get notifications to your phone.Remember to set your timezone.
Links from those emails will take you directly to the event in the usgs website. 
The cards or pins are the ones people focus on when they go to the events pages. However, there are many other options on the left, including “Download Event KML”, which you can use in Google Earth. 

* Interactive map- Seismicity in gray and white are historical data.
* Regional Information - to put info in context. Shows historical data, nearby places, from the epicenters and the population of those places. Underneath you’ll get basic info about the area where the earthquake happened. You can use this for background.
* Felt report - where people respond if they felt the earthquake, and this data feeds the “Did you feel it?” map, which is the pin next to “Felt report”.
* Did You Feel It? - If in the U.S., you can look up info by zip code. You can see Intensity vs. Distance, which will show how far away people felt the earthquake. There’s a “Downloads” button underneath for most of this information.
* ShakeMap - Shows seismic info measured by the USGS seismic instruments. There’s TV maps available in there. Made for use in television.
* Origin - basic info. Gets technical. Date, time in UTC, latitude, longitude and depth. 
* Moment Tensor - technical
* View Nearby Seismicity - shows you any foreshocks and aftershocks in the past and following three weeks of the earthquakes. Info is highlighted in blue.

If an earthquake can generate a tsunami, there’ll be a Tsunami card as a pin. You’ll see it if there’s the potential or if NOAA has sent out a notice about it. 

Some particular events include a “Tectonic summary.” Those are written by seismologists. 

There are multiple ways to get to the events place. You can get them by email from the ENS service, but there are other ways. 

Engineers deal with very heavy web traffic. The site should never crash. 

Back to home page!
You can click on the latest link on “Significant Earthquakes, Past 30 days.”

## Latest Earthquakes
You will start with a base map, but you can click on the earthquake’s info (the dot or the info on the left hand side), then the blue link underneath (on the left hand side) and be directed to the event. You can change the settings there too to get more info, see the faults in the map, change the time to your local time, look at the info in different formats, look by shakeMap or pager. Pager is to see the earthquake by terms of financial losses and by the amount of people losses. DYFI gives an estimate of the impact of the earthquakes when they occur. 

Earthquake Lists, Maps, and Statistics is where you can find historical data. 
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/

Under “Learn” section, you get Q&As and a Prepare section, for example. 

You may not want to go too much to Research, but there are articles written in plain language about the projects they’re working on at the time there. 

At the bottom of every page, there’s a Contact link. There’s a specific Media Contacts and Info link. 

## Session’s Q&A:
* PAGER info is usually updated once after an earthquake. Green is good because it means estimated fatalities and economical losses is low. This info is checked before it’s published, and gets updated about 2 hours after the earthquake. 
* ShakeMaps: if a region has enough shakemaps stations, then Did you Feel it is not incorporated. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/pager/faq.php
* More resources to check out http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/usarraygmv/ These visualizations show the waves from any world-wide earthquake M6.0+ cross the US
* Can we change the setting of the event web showing distance in mile and not km? No. There’s no setting for that on the latest earthquakes map. However, some of the pages have the info in miles and km. If you look at regional info, it has distance in km and mi from epicenter to other different places. In some places you can’t see it. 
* What is the communications plan if Internet and cell phone service goes down in the greater Los Angeles area?
That’s probably a communications plan from the city. LA- resilience by design is a plan by Mayor Eric Garcetti. For individuals, check for tips. For example, you can include chalk with your earthquake kits. Chalk or sharpies, standalone battery chargers, solar chargers, and check with your local community.
